This project contains SQL queries to analyze data from a Zomato-like food delivery platform. These queries explore various aspects of the platform, including customer behavior, restaurant performance, rider efficiency, and overall sales trends.

**Database Structure**:

The provided schema includes tables for:

* Customers: Stores customer information like ID, name, and registration date.
* Restaurants: Stores restaurant information like ID, name, city, and opening hours.
* Riders: Stores rider information like ID, name, and sign-up date.
* Orders: Stores order information like ID, customer ID, restaurant ID, order items, order date and time, order status, and total amount.
* Deliveries: Stores delivery information like ID, order ID, delivery status, delivery time, and rider ID.

**Data Cleaning**:

The repository includes comments suggesting queries to check for null values in each table. This helps identify missing data that may affect the analysis.

**EDA through Advanced Queries** :


* Customer Specific Information: Analyze most frequently ordered dishes by a specific customer within a specific timeframe.
* Popular Time Slots: Identify time slots with the highest order volume.
* Order Value Analysis: Find the average order value for customers with a high number of orders.
* High Value Customers: List customers who have spent a significant amount on food orders.
* Orders without Delivery: Analyze restaurants with orders placed but not delivered.
* Restaurant Revenue Ranking: Rank restaurants in each city based on their total revenue within a specific timeframe.
* Most Popular Dish by City: Find the most popular dish in each city based on order frequency.
* Customer Churn: Identify customers who haven't placed orders in the current year but did in the previous year.
* Cancellation Rate Comparison: Calculate and compare order cancellation rates for each restaurant over a specific period.
* Rider Average Delivery Time: Determine the average delivery time for each rider.
* Monthly Restaurant Growth Rate: Calculate the growth rate of delivered orders for each restaurant since joining the platform.
* Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on their total spending compared to the average order value (AOV).
* Rider Monthly Earnings: Calculate each rider's monthly earnings based on a commission percentage of the order total.
* Rider Ratings Analysis: Analyze the number of 5-star, 4-star, and 3-star ratings each rider receives based on delivery time.
* Order Frequency by Day: Analyze order frequency per day of the week and identify the peak day for each restaurant.
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer over their orders.
* Monthly Sales Trends: Compare total sales for each month with the previous month to identify trends.
* Rider Efficiency: Identify riders with the highest and lowest average delivery times.
* Order Item Popularity: Track the popularity of specific order items over time and identify seasonal demand spikes.
* Rank Cities by Revenue: Rank cities based on their total revenue for a specific year.

This set of queries provides valuable insights into Zomato-like platforms, enabling data-driven decisions regarding customer behavior, marketing strategies, operational efficiency, and resource allocation.
